# 🧪 LPIC-1 Lab: 102.5 Use RPM and YUM Package Management

#### I worked through hands-on tasks that helped me install, query, and remove packages. I also used commands to explore dependencies, signatures, and configuration files to gain control over package management operations in enterprise systems.

#### I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:

## 1️⃣RPM Basics – Installing, Upgrading, and Removing Packages
RPM is a powerful tool for working directly with .rpm package files. I started by downloading a few test .rpm files and using the rpm command to manage them.

🔹 Install a package using RPM:

🔹 Upgrade the same package to a newer version:

🔹 Remove a package:

## 2️⃣Querying RPM – Package Info, Files, and Dependencies
Once I had some packages installed, I practiced using RPM’s query options to retrieve detailed information.

🔹 List all installed packages:

🔹 Get detailed info about a package:

🔹 List all files a package provides:

🔹 Find out which package owns a specific file:

## 3️⃣YUM – Higher-Level Package Management
After working with RPM, I moved on to YUM, which abstracts away many of RPM’s manual processes and handles dependencies automatically.

🔹 Install a package:

🔹 Remove a package:

🔹 Update all packages in the system:

🔹 Search and view package info:

## 4️⃣YUM Configuration and Repository Management

🔹 Review the main YUM config file:

🔹 Explore YUM repositories:

## 5️⃣Awareness of DNF and Zypper
While not the focus of this objective, LPIC-1 expects awareness of other tools. I briefly tested them out.

🔹 Install software with DNF (Fedora/RHEL-based distros):

🔹 Use Zypper on Ubuntu:

## What I Learned
This lab helped me understand the real-world use of package managers in Linux systems and will absolutely strengthen my skillset as a future Linux administrator or DevOps engineer. 💪🐧
