# 🧪 LPIC-1 Lab: 102.5 Use RPM and YUM Package Management

#### I worked through hands-on tasks that helped me install, query, and remove packages. I also used commands to explore dependencies, signatures, and configuration files to gain control over package management operations in enterprise systems.

#### I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward📝:

## 1️⃣RPM Basics – Installing, Upgrading, and Removing Packages📦
RPM is a powerful tool for working directly with .rpm package files. I started by downloading a few test 💬.rpm files and using the rpm command to manage them.

🔹 Install a package using RPM:

🔹 Upgrade the same package to a newer version:

## 2️⃣DNF: Install, Upgrade, and Remove Packages
Once I had some packages installed, I practiced using RPM’s query options to retrieve detailed information.

🔹 List all installed packages:

🔹 Get detailed info about a package:
